		<p> A smart, curious, and adventurous 12-year-old boy spending the summer with his Great Uncle Stan in Gravity Falls, Oregon, where he and his sister constantly encounter the town's paranormal tendencies.

		<p>Dipper was born on August 31, 1999. His family lives in Piedmont, California. At a young age, Dipper's mother would dress him up in a lamb costume and have him perform his signature song and dance, the "Lamby Lamby Dance." He and Mabel were raised nonreligious, but celebrate all holidays at his sister's insistence. Since he was young, his favorite holiday has been Halloween, of which his favorite part is trick-or-treating with Mabel. He is also known to have been teased about his birthmark by other children until he started hiding it, which may be how he earned his nickname when he was no older than five. He also attended Eggbert Elementary with his sister.</p>

	<h1 id="Characteristics">Personality</h1>
		<p>Intelligent, compassionate, self-conscious and rational, and sometimes, overly judgmental, Dipper Pines can't wait to leave adolescence in the rear-view mirror. A born adventurer at heart, Dipper can't sit still and is always looking for the next riddle to solve. His scrupulous attention to detail comes in handy when he is off figuring out the mystery of the day, but sometimes his over-zealousness leaves others questioning his credibility</p>
